I am a research assistant at the [National Magnetic Resonance Research Center](https://umram.bilkent.edu.tr/), working under [Prof. Tolga Çukur](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cukur/). I receeived my M.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/). I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk/).

My interests lie in the field of machine learning and computer vision. I employ deep learning techniques to develop innovative generative models specifically designed for the reconstruction of medical images.
