I am a Master’s student in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department at Bilkent University, working under [Prof. Tolga Çukur](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cukur/). I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk/). 

My interests lie in the field of machine learning and computer vision. I employ deep learning techniques to develop innovative generative models specifically designed for the reconstruction of medical images.
